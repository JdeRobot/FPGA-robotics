 * ov7670_ctrl_reg_linux.vhd: similar to ov7670_ctrl_reg.vhd but using ov7670 registers from linux driver: https://github.com/yandex/smart/blob/master/drivers/media/i2c/ov7670.c

It works better at night, but in daylight it seems that is better the older one:

Left: old
Right: linux

[Nexys4 DDR configuration file using old registers for ov7670 camera](top_ov7670_nexys4ddr_oldregs.bit)

[Nexys4 DDR configuration file using linux registers for ov7670 camera synthetized with Vivado](top_ov7670_nexys4ddr_linuxregs_vivado.bit)
It is strange, but it doesnt work the same using Vivado or ISE, using Vivado colors are not ok
