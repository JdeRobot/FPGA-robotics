# Icestudio Color Filter with OV7670 camera and Alhambra II FPGA
  
  Same project as the Apio ov7670_rgb_yuv_80x60 adapted for icestudio.

  SW1: reset, necessary to start  

  SW2 choose between:

  RGB -> RGB test -> YUV -> YUV test -> RGB

  The drawback of choosing is that you loose pins for YUV, and you can only get 3 bits of gray color, without choosing you could get 5
