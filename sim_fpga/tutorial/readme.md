# Detailed examples of Verilator + GUI simulations

## [Tutorial 1](./tut01)

In this first example we _verilate_ the color processing Verilog module and create a GUI in which two images can be provided.
As a result, the color processed image is shown.

The module used is [../../phys_fpga/ulx3s/apio/ov7670_rgb_yuv_320x240_colorfilter/color_proc.v](../../phys_fpga/ulx3s/apio/ov7670_rgb_yuv_320x240_colorfilter/color_proc.v)

More info in its [tutorial 1 readme](./tut01)

## [Tutorial 2](./tut02)

We add and show in the GUI the centroid and proximity of the _verilated_ color processing Verilog module.

More info in its [tutorial 2 readme](./tut02)

## [Tutorial 3](./tut03)

In this example, instead of processing still images, the frames from the computer camera is processed by the _verilated_ color processing Verilog module.
